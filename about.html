            <p>This website is a simple guide to the Solar System. Here, you can learn about the planets, moons, the Sun, and other amazing objects in space. The goal is to make space knowledge fun and easy to understand.</p>

            <h2>Why Make This?</h2>
            <p>I made this website because I wanted to practice web design and also share something cool about the Solar System. Space has always been interesting to me, and I thought it would be fun to build a site where I can show what I’ve learned. While making this, I also got to practice coding, styling with CSS, and arranging things on a page. It’s not perfect, but it’s a project that shows both my interest in space and my journey in learning web development.</p>
